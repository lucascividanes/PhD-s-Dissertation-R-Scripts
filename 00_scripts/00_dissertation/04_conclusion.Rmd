# Conclusion {-}

So far, this research undertakes an exploratory investigation into the territorial connection of local legislators in Brazil, emphasizing strategies such as: incumbency advantage; the use(s) of individual budget amendments (IBAs); and the role of nonprofit-public partnerships (NPPPs). By studying three independent streams of literature around the topic of territorial connection -- electoral geography, distributive politics, and urban governance -- preliminary findings suggest that territorialization strategies may play a role in fostering political careers. Concentrated voting patterns, while not the most usual case, appear to constitute a relevant asset to representation.

The analyses suggest that the incumbency advantage may enhance territorial connections, particularly when paired with strategic use of IBAs. These tools are shown to extend beyond traditional pork-barrel politics, potentially serving as mechanisms for constituency service and broader governance objectives. Furthermore, NPPPs emerge as significant intermediaries, underscoring the role of third-sector actors in strengthening legislators’ ties to specific territories. However, these interpretations remain provisional and require further validation.

As an ongoing study, the research acknowledges limitations inherent to its current scope. The focus on São Paulo and a limited temporal framework still restricts generalizability. Nevertheless, the research methodological innovations and the comparative approach lay a solid foundation for subsequent extensions and refinements. Moving forward, future iterations of this research intend to expand the dataset to include additional legislative cycles and other large municipalities, providing a more comprehensive perspective.
