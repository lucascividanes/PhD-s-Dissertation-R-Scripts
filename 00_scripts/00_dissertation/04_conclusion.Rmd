# Conclusion {-}

So far, this research undertakes an exploratory investigation into the territorial connection of local legislators in Brazil, emphasizing strategies such as: incumbency advantage; the use(s) of individual budget amendments (IBAs); and the role of nonprofit-public partnerships (NPPPs). Through an integrative framework that combines electoral geography, distributive politics, and urban governance, preliminary findings suggest that territorialization strategies play a role in fostering political careers. Concentrated voting patterns, while not the norm, appear to facilitate political continuity and representation under certain conditions.

The early analyses suggest that incumbency advantage may enhance territorial connections, particularly when paired with strategic use of IBAs. These tools are shown to extend beyond traditional pork-barrel politics, potentially serving as mechanisms for constituency service and broader governance objectives. Furthermore, NPPPs emerge as significant intermediaries, underscoring the role of third-sector actors in strengthening legislators’ ties to specific territories. However, these interpretations remain provisional and require further validation.

As an ongoing study, the research acknowledges limitations inherent to its current scope. The focus on large municipalities and a limited temporal framework (two legislative cycles) restricts generalizability. Additionally, while the integration of geospatial and econometric analyses offers valuable insights, the findings should be viewed as exploratory. Nevertheless, the research’s methodological rigor and comparative approach lay a solid foundation for subsequent extensions and refinements.

This study's preliminary findings contribute to the understanding of territorialization strategies within Brazil's political system, offering initial insights into the complex interactions between legislators, discretionary resources, and urban governance mechanisms. Moving forward, future iterations of this research will expand the dataset to include additional legislative cycles and municipalities of varying sizes, providing a more comprehensive perspective. Additionally, longitudinal analyses will better capture the evolving dynamics of territorial connections and their implications for political representation.

By framing territorialization as a critical dimension of local politics, this ongoing research contributes to advancing both theoretical and practical discussions on representation and governance, with future iterations poised to refine and extend the findings presented here.
