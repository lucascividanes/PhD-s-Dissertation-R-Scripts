# The microrelations of nonprofit-public partnerships

## Introduction

This chapter intends to explore the brokerage mechanism that connects representatives and their constituencies in the territory. Investigating the uses of IBAs to foment nonprofit-public partnerships (NPPPs), I want to help to answer: *how relevant are organizational brokers to build territorial ties?* Territorial brokers are pivotal players in this game [@hoyler_politica_2023], and they may assume different forms based on their exchange logic as intermediaries between politicians and voters. Looking specifically at *organizational brokers* [@holland_beyond_2015], I sustain the hypothesis that *community-based organizations* [@marwell_privatizing_2004] are better suited to foster territorialization strategies, even though, the network of nonprofit organizations (NPOs) encompasses a set of distinct roles that are constitutive of both the territory and citywide governance dynamics [@sampson_great_2012; @marwell_microrelations_2020]. To test it, descriptive and inferential network analyses, based on data from the Map of Civil Society Organizations^[Available in: https://mapaosc.ipea.gov.br/.] and the novel dataset on IBAs restricted to MROSC^[*Marco Regulatório das Organizações da Sociedade Civil* (Regulatory Framework of Civil Society Organizations).] partnerships, will be used to draw and extract main patterns of the network in each city studied.

## Theoretical background

This chapter relies on theories that focus on meso-level analysis to explain urban phenomena. The main hypotheses concern the relational dimension that may support territorial connection. Similarly to Marwell et al. [-@marwell_microrelations_2020], I aim at connecting insights coming from different frameworks, such as urban ecology, urban governance and organizational sociology, to stress the microrelations of two key urban institutional domains -- politics and nonprofit organizations (NPOs) -- and their relationship with the neoinstitutionalist tradition explored so far.

As argued by Sampson, “urban scholars have proposed but never fully realized an alternative program of research whereby neighborhoods are regarded as pieces of a larger whole of an interlocking city or metropolis” [-@sampson_great_2012, p. 330]. The seminal (functionalist) interpretation of Park and Burgess [-@park_city_2019] pushed for a very fruitful research agenda on the role of the territorial dimension on urban explanations -- notably, at the scale of the neighborhood --, mostly associated with its *within* dynamics. In this sense, scholars of the (neo)ecological approach have highlighted a high-order social ordering of the city and its enduring (neighborhood) effects in urban inequalities -- not rarely, expressed in concentrated poverty and racial segregation -- that mediates individual actions and the composition of each community [@sampson_neighbourhood_2019]. But much less attention has been devoted to the *across* dynamics of the interlocking and cross-cutting networks that connect elites, organizations, and, ultimately, communities throughout the city.

The urban governance framework has been an effective tool in the pursuit of fulfilling this gap. The more encompassing and flexible perspective towards urban politics than former models, such as urban regime [@marques_continuities_2024], has opened new venues for analyses that overcome a monolithic and monotonic interpretation of the state, stressing the plurality of arrangements observed worldwide and the causes and consequences of different forms of interactions between societal actors and the local government [@pierre_can_2014]. Indeed, by stretching the “who governs?” question [@dahl_who_2005] to “who governs when nobody governs?” [@bridge_urban_2011], this framework helps to illuminate that governance is usually fragmented and subjected to multiple layers of influence that operates at different scales.

Therefore, I take an urban governance perspective -- i.e., defined as city’s processes of goal setting, steering, and implementation of collective outcomes in economic, political, and social affairs -- to shed light over the processes that are carried out via relational exchanges among public and private sector actors, under a set of formal and informal rules and conditions, and with the end result of a wide variety of goals, policies, and implementation routines [@da_cruz_new_2019]. Yet, I intend to overcome a drawback of this research agenda that has been the absence of systematically collected comparable data, limiting the possibilities of empirical research. In sum, the proliferation of many rich thick descriptions of complex governance arrangements have not been accompanied by more robust tests that aim at generalizing those findings with a comparative point of view -- even less likely with a south-north approach.

To connect this literature with the territorial connection and the institutionalist reasoning put forward by this dissertation, I’ll once again rely on the distributive politics debate, but now focusing on its brokerage mechanisms. Stokes et al. [-@stokes_brokers_2013] have formalized the exchange logics of those pivotal players in the game of nonprogrammatic politics. In short, brokers are the most important building blocks of what such literature has labeled as clientelism, being the intermediary actor responsible for connecting politicians and voters. In fact, it is their burden to identify, monitor and sanction voters coopted by targeted benefits that sustain the whole system.

However, the more normative views of those authors have overshadowed how brokers themselves have different logics that undergird their behavior, going beyond the caricature of machine politics that emphasizes more heavily the role of patronage and political parties on the electoral exchange that sustains brokerage mechanisms. Indeed, brokers may derive their legitimacy from multiple sources, such as interest associations, blurring the notions of principal-agent that usually sustains traditional clientelist reasoning [@holland_beyond_2015]. In short, for instance, organizational brokers, aspiring to pursuit organizational interests through rent-seeking of political action, would be a proper political actor [@marwell_privatizing_2004], more autonomous and able to bargain than previous acknowledged, and constituting an actual (informal) representative of specific constituencies in some degree [@hoyler_representacao_2022]. Responsiveness, therefore, become more complex than original models suggest and fuzzier lines separate what is partisan distribution or constituency service in nonprogrammatic politics [@bussell_clients_2019].

The accounts of the empirical tests assessed by this chapter dialogue with those theoretical streams by putting magnifying lens over nonprofit-public partnerships (NPPPs) financed via legislators’ discretionary funds. Nonprofit organizations (NPOs) has already been recognized as potential clientelist players, following the expansion of service provision based on those actors, in Brazil and abroad. In United States, for instance, Marwell [-@marwell_privatizing_2004] has mapped that, especially, community-based organizations (CBOs) -- i.e., nonprofits organized in and only for a particular geographic community and mostly relying on “community members” for daily activities -- are susceptible to be coopted by a triadic exchange connecting elected officials and voters through patronage resources and distribution via CBO. A similar mechanism was highlighted by Bueno [-@bueno_bypassing_2018] when stressing the distribution of discretionary funds to NPOs by federal legislators in Brazil to bypass the possibility of oppositional mayors’ credit claiming in policies implemented in their electoral territories. NPOs, therefore, although mostly neglected by the literature, can be relevant players in distributive politics.

Moreover, since 2014, Brazil has approved the MROSC^[*Marco Regulatório das Organizações da Sociedade Civil* (Regulatory Framework of Civil Society Organizations).], a more flexible and comprehensive law, that amplified the scope of civil society organizations -- in special, the nonprofit ones -- able to be fomented with public resources. In cities like São Paulo, the municipal regulation of such instrument, since 2017, placed large latitude in the hands of city councilors to direct the resources at their discretion to foment NPOs. Perhaps, an empirical evidence of this relationship is to be found in the rise of the Secretary of Culture as one of the main executors of city councilors’ individual budget amendments in that city, channeling a significant slice of those resources to NPOs based on MROSC partnerships [@gomes_role_2020]:

In short, as Hoyler’s extensive fieldwork has shown [@hoyler_representacao_2022; @hoyler_politica_2023], the territorial connection in a large city like São Paulo is sustained by a network of macro and microbrokers that connects hierarchically local politicians and their territorial constituencies. Those brokers, however, are not simply passive players in this game, by accumulating different formal and informal roles simultaneously, they usually envision to climb the ladder of political representation through territorial influence and rely on distinct sources of legitimacy for it. NPOs are one of those sources and studying the relational structure of city councilors and those civil society players may help to stress organizational brokerage dynamics.

A first test proposed by this chapter is that electoral connection is an important dimension to explain the relational patterns that city councilors have with NPOs. As shown by Marwell et al. [-@marwell_microrelations_2020], it can be expected that concentrated electoral metrics induce a kind of relationship that might be more exclusive, more long-lasting and more likely to happen with NPOs in their electoral territories. In contrast, less concentrated city councilors would tend to focus resources in NPOs based on short-lived, citywide patterns of relations. Hence, the first hypothesis states that:

*H1: City councilors with higher electoral concentration metrics will present patterns of relationship with NPOs in a more exclusive, long-lasting and territorialized way.*

Moreover, it is expected that patterns of relationship will be partly defined by the organizational structure existing in each city. Following the relational findings of São Paulo’s network of NPOs presented by Lavalle et al. [@lavalle_backstage_2008], it is expected that the electoral connection will dictate with whom local politicians develop ties. More centralized NPOs, such as popular organizations, coordinating bodies, and NGOs will be less likely to be found in the network of local politicians’ foment portfolio in general. Still, more concentrated voting patterns might induce an overreliance on partnerships with more structural peripheric NPOs, such as service nonprofits, community associations and neighborhood associations. Therefore, the second hypothesis affirms that:

*H2: City councilors with higher electoral concentration metrics will present patterns of relationship with less embedded NPOs, according to the city’s organizational network.*

## Methods

This chapter relies on network analysis to test the main hypotheses. This far, only descriptive methods will be applied, although in the future I have the ambition to also rely on inferential network analysis.

A network perspective differs from most traditional observational studies because of its focus on relational concepts or processes -- with not only methodological, but ontological and epistemological consequences [@emirbayer_manifesto_1997]. In other words, scholars are interested in the linkages among units of a given social environment and the patterns or regularities in relationships among interacting units -- its structure. Therefore, “the unity of analysis in network analysis is not the individual, but an entity consisting of a collection of individuals and the linkages among them” [@wasserman_social_1994, p. 3].

Hence, a frequent assumption of independence of most frameworks for statistical analysis -- properly saying, that units under study are drawn independently at random from some underlying distribution or data-generating process -- is surpassed precisely because we are interested in studying how the units depend upon each other, i.e., the interdependence between individuals [@cranmer_inferential_2021].

Therefore, as pointed out by Hanneman and Riddle [-@hanneman_introduction_2005], there are two major emphasis of network analysis: to see how actors are located or “embedded” in the overall network; and to see how the whole pattern of individual choices gives rise to more holistic patterns -- Granovetter’s [-@granovetter_strength_1973] so-called “aerial view.” For that, scholars usually rely on structural and compositional variables to measure the positions and roles of entities in the more encompassing network of relations.

Those measures, though, vary according to the type of network. In this case, we are speaking of a two-mode unidirectional network, also referred to as a bipartite network: that is to say, a network composed of two sets of distinct actors -- city councilors and NPOs -- where only one set of actors can build directed ties with the other set of actors [-@galaskiewicz_mimetic_1989]. In this case, for instance, a typical centrality measure, such as the degree, or the number of ties a specific actor concentrates, is divided into indegrees and outdegrees according to the set of actors under study. Density, a traditional measure of cohesion, is also adapted to a smaller number of potential ties, since relations can only be observed across the two sets of actors. Still, many ideas common to one-mode network analysis, such as center-periphery, brokerage-intermediation, cliques-clusters, bonding-bridging ties, among others, can also be applied with a few adaptations. That being said, the chapter, so far, concerns only basic exploratory metrics for the studied network. To be enriched in the future work.

The data used to test the hypotheses comes from LAI^[*Lei de Acesso à Informação* (Law of Access to Information).] requests concerning the use of IBAs by city councilors to foment NPPPs. So far, the data encompasses only the case of the municipality of São Paulo for the Secretary of Culture in the year of 2019, but, in the future, it may encompass all IBAs used for this purpose for the two last legislatures (2017-2024) in that municipality. Complementarily, I rely on data from the Map of Civil Society Organizations^[Available in: https://mapaosc.ipea.gov.br/.] to bring a more comprehensive understanding of civil society as a whole.

Before diving into the network analysis more properly, it is important to stress the relevance of NPPPs in the Secretary of Culture in recent years. As already mentioned, Culture, as well as Sports and Leisure, are usually the most solicited secretaries in the municipality of São Paulo in terms of IBAs, executing about 20% of the total amount of resources at city councilors’ discretion each. Specifically in 2019, the Secretary of Culture alone was responsible for the execution of nothing less than 32% of all the IBAs resources in the municipality -- equivalent to R\$ 66 million. Of this value, 37% was spent having NPOs as beneficiaries based on MROSC regulation. In short, NPPPs in the Secretary of Culture represented more than 10% of IBAs execution in volume of resources -- about R\$ 25 million --, with 36 city councilors fomenting 85 distinct NPOs.

In turn, the Map of Civil Society Organizations accounts for more than 50 thousand NPOs registered in the municipality of São Paulo in 2020. Not exclusively, 37% of those NPOs were identified as having a “religious” scope of action, followed by 24% with focus on “development and rights defense”, 10% in “education and research” and 9% in “culture and recreation”, among others. As presented in Table 3.1, in comparison with the NPPPs portfolio of the Secretary of Culture, two points become clearer: firstly, only a tiny fraction of the universe of NPOs in the municipality of São Paulo does establish relationships with local politicians -- even restricted to the scope of “culture and recreation”, only 18 in an universe of 4.619, or 0,4%; secondly, and surprisingly, “social assistance” NPOs are overrepresented in the cultural NPPPs portfolio, followed by the proper “culture and recreation” ones and with “development and rights defense” next.

At first, one can note that there is one big network that is organized around two main clusters, mainly composed of shared-scattered and dominant-concentrated classes of city councilors, surrounded by disconnected networks established overall by politicians with exclusive ties with NPOs. Interestingly, 19 city councilors do not establish any tie and are isolated, especially those in the dominant-concentrated class. As presented in Table 3.2, the mean outdegree tend to be smaller for dominant city councilors and, for those who establish ties, the scattered-shared ones are more likely to have relations with more popular NPOs (measured as the mean indegree of the NPOs a given politician developed a tie). In terms of density, only 128 links of a total of 2.890 possibilities are actually developed, or only 4%.

## Discussion

Results so far are only exploratory. A more comprehensive dataset based on NPPPs for the last two legislatures and concerning all secretaries will provide a better picture of the phenomena under study. Adjustments should be made in the classification as well, since the distribution now seems very unbalanced. Moreover, further descriptive metrics and inferential analysis are intended to be used to test the hypotheses drawn before.

Following Marwell et al. [-@marwell_microrelations_2020], event history models may help to test how concentration induce different kinds of behavior when forming a tie, following the multiple configurations of electoral connection reasoning. But more sophisticated statistical inference, such as the reliance on exponential random graph model (ERGM), among other techniques, are being studied [@cranmer_inferential_2021].

Finally, to improve the quality of the findings, two alternatives are envisioned. The first is to use a multimethod path, integrating qualitative evidence to uncover the mechanisms that may support the quantitative findings of the network analysis [@fearon_integrating_2011]. The second one is based on the idea of the comparative gesture advocated so far and seeks to expand the scope of the analysis for a south-north comparison, including the city of New York as a second case study [@robinson_cities_2011]. São Paulo and New York^[Data on NPOs foment via legislators’ discretionary funds are very well organized and available at: https://www.nyc.gov/html/citycouncil/html/budget/expense_funding.shtml.] share many similarities, but have very distinct electoral rules, representing an effective opportunity to study neoinstitutionalist hypotheses.
